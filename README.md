I think that, I should give a try different technologies to understand where technology goes.To understand that
, i'll watch one full course about different technology every month.This was the first one.I forgot adding git every step but
i'll do it on other courses.I know, just sitting and  watching what coach did,is not useful to learn something.To pass that, will code all things and i'll add git to every meaningful step.And also,I wish that, as soon as possible i'll publish my ideas on my own blog.In this way, i believe that my productivity and organisation of my ideas will be better.

Sorry, if i made mistake on my paragraph(punctuation,spelling, e.g).
